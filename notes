TODO: 
- [x] Add the `redux-logger` middleware to the project for debugging
- [x] Add `redux-sagas` to the project to make an API request. 
      The route `http://localhost:5000/api/plant` returns an array of plants. 
      Display that array on the `Garden` component on load.
- [x] Add all of the plant fields to the form to allow adding a new plant to the database. 
      The server `post` route to do this is available at `http://localhost:5000/api/plant`.
- [ ] Add a `Delete` button for each plant to allow it to be removed from the database. 
      The server `delete` route to do this is available at `http://localhost:5000/api/plant/1`, 
      or the plant with the `id` of `1`.
